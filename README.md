# Stripe, Inc. Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Stripe, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, in 2009 by Patrick and John Collison. 

The idea for the project was a result of personal experiences Patrick and John had when trying to make payments on the web. 

Stripe was initially funded by venture capital. Receiving seed funding of $2 million from Sequoia Capital, SV Angel, and Andreesen Horowitz. More recently, Stripe raised $2.2B of funding in June, 2021. 


## Business Activities


Stripe is attempting to decrease the difficulty and risk associated with making payments online. In short, "Stripe makes it easy for developers to accept credit cards on the web." 


eCommerce businesses are the intended customer for Stripe's product. The end user of the product is anyone that wishes to make a purchase using Stripe's platform. The Global Payment Processing Solutions market was $39 B in 2020, and is projected to reach $146 B by 2030. Stripe has some of their customers listed publicly on their website. These customers include: Shopify, Amazon, Instacart, Peloton, and Wayfair. 


Stripe has several unique advantages that give them an edge over thier competetors. One such advantage is Stripe's strategic partnership with well-known brands. " Stripe recently partnered with Alipay and WeChat Pay in China. In addition, they announced an integration with Apple Pay, thus allowing users to use the existing payment information already stored within their Apple account for transactions without entering credit card details again and again." - John Hughes of Business Chronicler. 
John also list that in addition to strategic partnerships, Stripe has a strong developer community. With a user friendly API and simple process for app makers, Stripe decreases the barrier to entry for new vendors looking to enter the ecommerce space. 


Stripe's tech stack is currently programmed primarily in Ruby and Javascript. With the back-end of Stripe being built on Ruby, and the API and front end involving more Javascript. Additional technologies used by Stripe include: Mandrill, Framer, CircleCI, and Asana. 

## Landscape

Stripe exists in the payments FinTech domain. 

Major trends relating to the payments domain include increasing ease-of-use, data protection, and reliability (uptime). Fraud protection is one specific innovation that has come in recent years. FinTech companies are able to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and block fraudulent payments. Additionally, being able to store payment data for later use (ie Paypal) makes it easier for consumers to make payments the next time they would like to make a purchase. 

Peer to peer lending is another utility becoming increasingly common in the FinTech payments field, with companies such as Venmo and Zelle offering low fee transactions to send mondey to others using the platform. 


Other competitors and players in this domain include Square, Adyen, Klarna, Sezzle, Paypal, and Venmo. These companies have various specialties and areas of focus, whether it is Venmo's peer-to-peer payments, or Klarna's buy-now-pay-later. 

## Results

Key performance indicators for companies in the payments domain includes monthly recurring revenue, active subscribers, and average revenue per subscriber. 
Because Stripe is a privately held company, they are not required to disclose these financial metrics. What is known about Stripe's performance is that it was most recently internally valued at $74 B in July 2022, down from $95 B in 2021. 
Payment volume is one metric that can be found for Stripe and some competitors. In 2020, Stripe did $350B in payment volume, compared to $106B by Square, and $367B by Adyen. Stripe has shown consistent, significant growth and are positioning themselves well in the payments domain. 

## Recommendations


In my view one product that Stripe would be well positioned to add to it's product portfolio would be an option for consumers to purchase with credit. By giving users the ability to buy a product with no money down, certain vendors/ecommerce platforms may be more likely to choose them over their competetors such as Sezzle and Klarna. Because this would be a new product space for Stripe, they would be able to attract customers that are not already using Stripe's products, allowing Stripe to grow it's value more quickly. Stripe could either build buy now pay later capabilities themselves, or aquire an existing company to utilize their tech and capture their existing customer portfolio. A BNPY product would utilize a similar tech stack already being used by Stripe: Javasript, Python, AWS to allow for efficient and secure data processing.
