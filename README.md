Research regarding the payments domain in FinTech. 

# Title

## Overview and Origin

Stripe, Inc.

Stripe, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, in 2009 by Patrick and John Collison. 

The idea from the project was a result of personal experiences Patrick and John had when trying to make payments on the web. 

Stripe was initially funded by venture capital. Receiving seed funding of $2 million from Sequoia Capital, SV Angel, and Andreesen Horowitz. 


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Stripe is attempting to decrease the difficulty and risk associated with making payments online. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
eCommerce businesses are the intended customer for Stripe's product. The end user of the product is anyone that wishes to make a purchase using Stripe's platform. The Global Payment Processing Solutions market was $39 B in 2020, and is projected to reach $146 B by 2030. 


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Stripe has several unique advantages that give them an edge over thier competetors. One such advantage is Stripe's strategic partnership with well-known brands. " Stripe recently partnered with Alipay and WeChat Pay in China. In addition, they announced an integration with Apple Pay, thus allowing users to use the existing payment information already stored within their Apple account for transactions without entering credit card details again and again."
In addition to strategic partnerships, Stripe has a strong developer community. With a user friendly API and simple process for app makers, Stripe decreases the barrier to entry for new vendors looking to enter the ecommerce space. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Stripe's tech stack is currently programmed primarily in Ruby and Javascript. With the back-end of Stripe being built on Ruby, and the API and front end involving more Javascript. 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Stripe exists in the payments FinTech domain. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
Increasing ease-of-use, data protection, and reliability (uptime) are all major trends relating to the payments domain. Fraud protection is one specific innovation that has come in recent years. FinTech companies are able to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and block fraudulent payments. Additionally, being able to store payment data for later use (ie Paypal) makes it easier for consumers to make payments the next time they would like to make a purchase. 


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other competitors and players in this domain include Square, Klarna, Sezzle, Paypal, and Venmo. These companies have various specialties and areas of focus, whether it is Venmo's peer-to-peer payments, or Klarna's buy-now-pay-later. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Key performance indicators for companies in the payments domain includes monthly recurring revenue, active subscribers, and average revenue per subscriber. 
Because Stripe is a privately held company, they are not required to disclose these financial metrics. What is known about Stripe's performance is that it was most recently internally valued at $74 B in July 2022, down from $95 B in 2021. 


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
In my view one product that Stripe would be well positioned to add to it's product portfolio would be an option for consumers to purchase with credit. By giving users the ability to buy a product with no money down, certain vendors/ecommerce platforms may be more likely to choose them over their competetors such as Sezzle and Klarna. 



* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
